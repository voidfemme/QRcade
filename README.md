# QRcade

QRcade is an experimental game engine that enables games to be distributed and played through QR codes. By storing compiled Lua bytecode in QR codes, games can be instantly loaded and played by simply scanning the code. This unique approach opens up interesting possibilities for game distribution and sharing.

## üéÆ Key Features

### Core Engine
- Entity Component System (ECS) architecture for efficient game object management
- Lua scripting integration for game logic
- Performant 2D rendering using SDL2
- Robust event system for input handling

### Game Development Tools
- Text rendering system for UI and game messages
- Tilemap system for level design
- Physics system with gravity and collision detection
- Drag-and-drop interaction system
- Debug visualization tools for development

### Component Systems
- Transform system for positioning and rotation
- Velocity system for movement
- Collision system for object interaction
- Renderable system for sprites and shapes
- Text system for UI elements
- Tilemap system for level design

## üöß Project Status

QRcade is currently in early alpha development. While the core systems are functional, they are still being refined and may undergo significant changes. The project is actively being developed with a focus on:

- Stability and performance improvements
- Enhanced documentation and examples
- Additional game development features
- Better error handling and debugging tools
- QR code generation and scanning optimization

### Known Limitations
- Limited to 2D games currently
- Basic physics implementation
- QR code size limitations affect game complexity
- Work in progress documentation

## üìñ Documentation

The engine includes comprehensive Lua API documentation for game development:
- [Engine Documentation](engine/docs/index.md)
- [API Reference](engine/docs/index.md#documentation-overview)
- [Example Games](engine/resources/lua_scripts/)
